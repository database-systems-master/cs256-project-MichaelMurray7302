Project Proposal

Domain
My project will be to create a database that contains movies, their ratings, directors, notable actors, production company, etc.

Movies can be organized by a certain director , actor, production company, genre, ratings, year released, budget etc.
Every movie contains at least one director, actor, production company.

Motivation
This database will be useful to anyone that avidly watches movies. If the user is fond of a certain actor,
they could find other movies they were in. Similarly, the user could find more movies from a certain director they may not have known about.
Users will access the database through a website. Users can search by actor, by director, by movie title, etc.

This system may not be necessarily better than certain movie websites such as Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb,
but the benefit to this system is that ratings will be pulled from a variety of sources instead of the aforementioned websites' own.
The rating could be specified between audience and critic ratings.
Considering there will be no popularity variable, it will be more likely for a user to find lesser known 'hidden gems.'
The proposed database might not be as good or better than existing movie databases, but aims to be able to pull
a bunch of different information about movies. This will be useful as time goes on, movies can be added as they come out, or
older movies that weren't though of could be added as well.
